## AWS CI/CD Pipeline

This project implements a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for infrastructure and application deployments on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Built With

- CircleCI: Cloud-based CI/CD service for automating builds, tests, and deployments.
- AWS: Cloud platform providing scalable and secure infrastructure services.
- AWS CLI: Command-line interface for interacting with AWS services directly from your terminal.
- CloudFormation: Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool for defining and provisioning AWS resources in a declarative format.
- Ansible: Powerful configuration management tool for automating the configuration of software, servers, and cloud resources.
- Prometheus: Open-source monitoring tool for collecting and analyzing application and infrastructure metrics.

### Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline is typically divided into the following stages:

- Source Code Management (SCM): Code changes are pushed to a version control system like Git.
- Build: CircleCI triggers a build job to perform tasks like:
- Downloading dependencies
- Building the application
- Running unit tests
- Linting code for quality assurance
- Test (optional): If applicable, additional tests like integration or acceptance tests can be run in this stage.
- Infrastructure Deployment: CloudFormation templates define infrastructure resources. The AWS CLI or Ansible can execute deployments based on environment (e.g., dev, staging, production).
- Application Deployment: Ansible or a custom deployment script can be used to deploy the application to the provisioned infrastructure.
- Monitoring: Prometheus collects metrics and provides insights into application and infrastructure health.
